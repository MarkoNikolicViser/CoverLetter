            <ul>
                <li>Is it better to follow your dream or to investigate the job market when choosing a profession?</li>
                <p>I think it's better to follow the dream because the most important thing is to do something you love.</p>
                <li>If you have the chance to address only 1 question to the CEO, what would it be? Explain why.</li>
                <p>The question I would address to CEO is: What do you expect from your employees? I want to know what is the average expectation of an employee to make the CEO satisfied.</p>
                <li>Describe a time where you made a mistake, and how you handled it and what have you learned from it.</li>
                <p>I've made a mistake when I trying to pass my exam, I was failing because I was not trying my best to pass, I overcome my mistake by studying more, and finally pass the exam. I've learned that sometimes I need to try harder.</p>
